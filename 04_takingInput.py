# all this input, print are built in function of the python library and let's us perform basic tasks of I/O
# this input function prints the string passed into it and waits for the input from user side
# and then after user enters a input it will return that.
name = input("What is Your Name?? ")
# + sign between two strings means concatination of both without any space between them
print("Hemlloo! " + name);
